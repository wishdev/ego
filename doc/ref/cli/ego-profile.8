.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH HISTORY
.sp
Historically, users have had to add a large number of settings to \fB/etc/make.conf\fP to customize their Gentoo or Funtoo
Linux system, which made setup of the operating system more difficult than it should be. In Gentoo Linux, it is possible
to only define one system profile. Think of a system profile as the default settings that Portage uses for building
everything on your system. Rather than a single profile, Funtoo Linux uses multiple sub\-profiles, and moves many types
of settings that are normally stored in \fB/etc/make.conf\fP into the profile system.
.SH PROFILE TYPES
.sp
The following profile types are available in Funtoo Linux:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBarch\fP
Typically x86\-32bit or x86\-64bit, this defines the processor type and support of your system. This is defined when
your stage was built and should not be changed.
.TP
.B \fBbuild\fP
Defines whether your system is a current, stable or experimental build. current systems will have newer packages
unmasked than stable systems. This is defined when your stage is built and is typically not changed. Note that
currently, only \fBfuntoo\-current\fP is being used.
.TP
.B \fBsubarch\fP
Defines CPU optimizations for your system. The subarch is set at the time the stage3 is built, but can be changed
later to better settings if necessary. Be sure to pick a setting that is compatible with your CPU.
.TP
.B \fBflavor\fP
Defines the general type of system, such as server or desktop, and will set default USE flags appropriate for your
needs.
.TP
.B \fBmix\-ins\fP
Defines various optional settings that you may be interested in enabling.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that flavors can (and often do) inherit settings from other flavors and mix\-ins. Mix\-ins can also inherit settings
from other mix\-ins. For example, the \fBX\fP mix\-in is inherited by \fBgnome\fP\&. The \fBepro\fP tool will show both as being
enabled so there are no surprises.
.SH USING EPRO
.sp
\fBepro show\fP will display the current profile settings on your system:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

To view all available sub\-profile settings, use \fBepro list\fP\&. Enabled profiles will be highlighted in cyan. Directly
enabled profiles will be in bold and have an asterisk \fB*\fP appended. Sub\-profiles enabled via inheritance will be
highlighted.
.SH USAGE EXAMPLES
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBepro mix\-ins +gnome +kde\fP
Add the \fBkde\fP and \fBgnome\fP mix\-ins.
.TP
.B \fBepro mix\-ins \-gnome\fP
Remove the \fBgnome\fP mix\-in.
.TP
.B \fBepro arch x86\-64bit\fP
Change the arch profile to \fBx86\-64bit\fP\&. You typically would not do this.
.TP
.B \fBepro subarch generic_64\fP
Enable the \fBgeneric_64\fP subarch and associated compiler settings.
.TP
.B \fBepro flavor desktop\fP
Change the system flavor to \fBdesktop\fP
.TP
.B \fBepro show\-json\fP
Output profile settings in standard JSON format, suitable for embedding.
.TP
.B \fBepro get flavor\fP
Show current setting for flavor in plain\-text format, suitable for scripting.

.SH ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION
.sp
Please see \fI\%http://www.funtoo.org/Funtoo_Profiles\fP (\fBedoc "Funtoo Profiles" | less\fP) for more detailed documentation,
including a list of all flavors, mix\-ins, detailed documentation on Funtoo Linux media mix\-ins, how profile settings are
stored in Funtoo Linux, as well as information about the history of the profile system, originally envisioned by Daniel
Robbins and brought to life by Seemant Kulleen.
