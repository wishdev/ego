SYNOPSIS
--------

  */etc/ego.conf*

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The data in */etc/ego.conf* is used by *ego(8)* for configuration of kits and other settings relevant to ego commands.
The configuration file format is similar to Microsoft Windows .INI files and is parsed by the Python ConfigParser
module.

Sections are delimited with the literal format ``[SECTIONNAME]``. Currently, the following sections are supported:
*global*, *kits*. Values in each section are defined using the format ``KEY = VALUE``, one per line.

Global Section
==============

The *global* section supports the following configuration variables: *install_path*, *kits_path*, *meta_repo_path*,
*sync_user*.

**install_path**

For developers, this allows one to specify an alternate location where ego is installed. This defaults to
``/usr/share/ego``.

**kits_path**

Use this setting to specify the path to the kits directory used by meta-repo. When set to a relative path, this path
will be relative to *meta_repo_path*, but it can also be set to an absolute path, in which case it will be interpreted
as-is. The default settings for *kits_path* is "kits".

**meta_repo_path**

This setting defines the directory that will house meta-repo once cloned, and also where ego and Portage will look for
meta-repo. The default value for *meta_repo_path* is ``/var/git/meta-repo``.

**sync_user**

This setting defines the user and group that are used to perform the sync operation, and thus the user and group which
will end up owning the meta-repo files. The default value for *sync_user* is ``portage``.

**sync_base_url**

This setting defines the base URL to use for cloning of kits as well as meta-repo. Default value is
``https://github.com/funtoo/{repo}``. The ``{repo}`` value is replaced with the name of the kit or with the literal
value ``meta-repo``. Note that this setting only takes effect upon first clone, and if changed, you should remove
meta-repo and kits and perform an initial ``ego sync`` to reinitialize the repositories.

**meta_repo_branch**

This setting defines the default meta-repo branch to use. Default is ``master``.

Kits Section
============

The *kits* section is used to specify non-default branches to use for Funtoo Linux kits. By default, ``ego`` will use
the *default* kit defined by Funtoo Linux BDFL. This information is stored in the ``metadata/kit-info.json`` in the
meta-repo directory. Users who would prefer to use alternate branches can override these selections as follows::

  [kits]

  xorg-kit = 1.19-prime
  python-kit = 3.6-prime

After changing default kit values, be sure to run ``ego sync`` to update meta-repo to point to the correct kits. Also
be sure to run ``epro update`` to regenerate your profile information (in some cases, this can be done manually by
``ego sync``).
